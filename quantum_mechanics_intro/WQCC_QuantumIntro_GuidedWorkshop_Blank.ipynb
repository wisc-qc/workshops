    "We've talked about how superposition is one of the special features of quantum mechanics that quantum computers make use of before. Here's your chance to see it in action! Recall that stationary states are states that have well-defined energies and time independent probability distributsions. It turns out that any general wavefunction for a particle in a box can be decomposoed as a sum of stationary states:\n",
